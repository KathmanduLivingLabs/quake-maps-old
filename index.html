<h1>KLL Quake Maps</h1>

<p>The objective of this site is to distribute maps extracted from OpenStreetMap data to aid in Earthquake mapping. The data has been developed by thousands of crowd-sourced volunteers, and in our estimations provides the most up to date maps of Nepal.</p>

<p>Maps will soon be available for all 11 priority districts, and updated as frequently as we can.</p>

<p>With prayers for efficient recovery, the Kathmandu Living Labs team.</p>
